//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! One screen a person can read at a glance, and paste into an issue. It is the
//! least precise surface simon has and the most looked at, which is exactly why
//! it must not round an absence into a plausible number.
//!
//! # Unknown is printed as unknown
//!
//! Every other tool of this shape prints a dash, a zero, or omits the line. This
//! one prints the reason where there is room for it, because the difference
//! between "this machine has no GPU" and "simon cannot read GPUs on this
//! platform" is the difference between buying hardware and filing a bug.
//!
//! The rendering is deliberately built from [`crate::ontology::resolve`] rather
//! than from the individual monitors. One resolver means one set of answers: a
//! summary that disagreed with `simon snapshot` about the same machine would
//! make both untrustworthy, and the summary is the one people quote.
