//! SATA SMART attributes on Windows, without elevation.
//!
//! `IOCTL_STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE` returns a `STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE`: the
//! drive's own failure prediction, plus 512 vendor-specific bytes which, for an
//! ATA device, are verbatim the SMART READ DATA structure that
//! [`super::ata_smart`] parses. The storage driver issues the ATA command on the
//! caller's behalf, so the caller never needs to.
//!
//! # Why not `IOCTL_ATA_PASS_THROUGH`
//!
//! Because it cannot be done unelevated, which is the whole point of the exercise.
//! `IOCTL_ATA_PASS_THROUGH` is declared `CTL_CODE(IOCTL_SCSI_BASE, 0x040b,
//! METHOD_BUFFERED, FILE_READ_ACCESS | FILE_WRITE_ACCESS)`, so the I/O manager
//! checks the handle's access mask before the driver is ever reached — and a
//! handle on `\\.\PhysicalDriveN` with read and write access requires
//! Administrator. Issued on the zero-access handle that makes the NVMe path work,
//! it returns `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` (0x80070005). Measured on all four physical
//! drives of the development machine, unelevated.
//!
//! `IOCTL_STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE` is `CTL_CODE(IOCTL_STORAGE_BASE, 0x0440,
//! METHOD_BUFFERED, FILE_ANY_ACCESS)`. On the same zero-access handle it reaches
//! the driver, which is what makes this route viable at all.
//!
//! # What this cannot get
//!
//! Failure thresholds. Those come from SMART READ THRESHOLDS, a separate ATA
//! command with no `IOCTL_STORAGE_*` equivalent, so every attribute here is
//! reported with a threshold of zero — which is also ATA's own encoding for "no
//! threshold", the value that never trips.
//!
//! # Verification status
//!
//! **The ioctl path has not been run against a SATA drive.** The development
//! machine has three NVMe drives and no ATA device; on all of them this returns
//! `Error::NotSupported`, derived from the `ERROR_INVALID_FUNCTION` the NVMe
//! driver answers with — which does confirm the control code passes the access
//! check on a zero-access handle, and that the not-an-ATA-device case is handled,
//! but says nothing about the parse. The 512-byte structure is covered by
//! [`super::ata_smart`]'s tests against synthetic buffers. Anyone with a SATA SSD
//! or HDD should compare `simon disk smart` against `smartctl -A` once; that is
//! the check this has not had.
