//! Did the setting help? Measure, decide, and put it back if it hurt.
//!
//! This closes the loop that [`crate::tuning::serve`] left open. 5.1.0 made
//! writes reversible; nothing yet decided *whether to reverse them*. A tuner
//! that can apply and undo but cannot tell the two apart is still guessing, it
//! just guesses in both directions.
//!
//! # The rule this module exists to enforce
//!
//! **A loop that invents a success criterion is the optimiser equivalent of a
//! model picking a power limit.** The same rule that governs proposed values
//! governs this: the criterion has to come from somewhere defensible, not from
//! whatever number happened to be readable.
//!
//! So the verdict space includes [`Verdict::Unverifiable`], and it is the
//! default rather than the exception. If no metric is declared for a setting, or
//! the metric cannot be read, or the machine is too idle for the metric to mean
//! anything, the answer is "unverifiable" — never "improved".
//!
//! # Why the registry is nearly empty
//!
//! Not an oversight, and not a stub to fill in later. Declaring a metric means
//! claiming that this number moves when that setting changes, and most of those
//! claims do not survive being checked.
//!
//! The obvious metric for a CPU power-scheme change is achieved clock speed, and
//! on Windows it does not work. `CallNtPowerInformation(ProcessorInformation)`
//! reports `CurrentMhz`, which is what [`crate::platform::windows::read_cpu_stats`]
//! surfaces as `CpuFrequency::current`. Measured on the development machine: 16
//! spinning threads took system idle from 79.7% to 11.4%, and every core
//! reported exactly 4400 MHz throughout, before and after. It is the nominal
//! clock, not a live one. A verifier built on it would have reported "no
//! change" for every power scheme in existence and been believed.
//!
//! That is the whole reason [`metric_for`] returns `None` for
//! `active_scheme_guid` on Windows. The setting is applied and reversible; it is
//! simply not measurable with anything this crate can currently read, and saying
//! so is the honest output.
//!
//! # Noise
//!
//! One reading before and one after is noise, not evidence. Every measurement is
//! a window of samples reduced to a median, with a median absolute deviation
//! carried alongside it. A difference counts only when it clears both the
//! metric's declared minimum effect *and* the noise observed in the two windows
//! themselves — so a metric that happens to be jittery today raises its own bar
//! rather than producing a confident verdict from noise.
//!
//! # What gets reverted
//!
//! Only [`Verdict::Regressed`]. Not `Unchanged`, and emphatically not
//! `Unverifiable` — reverting on "I could not tell" would undo nearly every
//! write this crate makes, which is a different way of ignoring the measurement
//! rather than a safer one. A setting that demonstrably made things worse comes
//! off; everything else is left where the caller put it, and reported.
