//! The automatic tuning server: watch what the machine is doing, and say what
//! would suit it.
//!
//! # It does not write unless told to, twice
//!
//! Default behaviour is [`Mode::Recommend`] — the loop classifies, plans, and
//! publishes. Nothing is applied. Turning that into [`Mode::Apply`] requires the
//! caller to pass a risk ceiling *and* confirmation, and even then every write
//! goes through [`crate::profile::apply::apply_setting`], which refuses without
//! `confirm` and writes an audit record.
//!
//! That is deliberately more friction than an optimiser usually has. AGENTS.md
//! states that writing requires `--confirm` and that the library never elevates
//! itself; a server that quietly rewrote power settings would make that sentence
//! false, and the sentence is load-bearing for anyone who deployed simon on the
//! strength of it.
//!
//! The ceiling defaults to [`SettingRisk::Safe`] and is capped at
//! [`SettingRisk::Moderate`] for unattended operation. `Dangerous` covers
//! power, thermal, voltage and MSR writes — the settings that can damage
//! hardware — and no unattended loop in this crate will apply one.
