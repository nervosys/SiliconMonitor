//! Use-case detection and hardware profile recommendations.
//!
//! Two separable jobs, kept separate on purpose:
//!
//! 1. **What is this machine doing?** — [`classify`] answers with a [`UseCase`],
//!    a confidence, and the evidence it rested on. This is a judgement, and it is
//!    labelled as one.
//! 2. **What settings suit that?** — [`plan_from_settings`] answers with [`Recommendation`]s
//!    whose proposed values come from what the driver itself declared: an entry in
//!    the setting's `choices`, or its `default`. Never a number this module made up.
//!
//! # Why the split matters
//!
//! An optimiser is only as trustworthy as its worst suggestion, and the tempting
//! design — ask a language model for a power limit — produces a number with no
//! provenance that cannot be checked against anything the hardware said. That is
//! the failure this repository's ontology exists to prevent, and it would be
//! worse here than in a reading, because a reading is only believed while a
//! setting is *written*.
//!
//! So a model may classify the workload, where being wrong costs a suboptimal
//! profile. It may not choose values. [`Recommendation::basis`] records where each
//! proposed value came from, and
//! [`tests::a_recommendation_never_proposes_a_value_the_driver_did_not_offer`]
//! makes that enforceable rather than aspirational.
//!
//! # Nothing here writes
//!
//! This module computes plans. Applying one goes through
//! [`crate::profile::apply::apply_setting`], which refuses without explicit
//! confirmation and writes an audit record — the contract AGENTS.md states, and
//! which the automatic server in [`serve`] does not get to bypass.
