//! Lock-free snapshot pipeline: decouples hardware collection from rendering.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Before this module, every frontend (CLI, TUI, GUI) called blocking collectors
//! directly on its render thread. A slow WMI or NVML query would stall a frame,
//! and [`crate::backend::MonitoringBackend::update`] ran every collector serially,
//! so the slowest source set the floor for all of them.
//!
//! This module inverts that:
//!
//! - A dedicated **collector thread** owns all hardware handles and never shares them.
//! - Independent collectors run **concurrently** within each tick, so total tick cost
//!   is the slowest single collector rather than their sum.
//! - Results are published as an immutable [`Snapshot`] into an [`ArcSwap`] slot.
//!   Readers do a lock-free atomic load and never block, never wait on a mutex, and
//!   never touch a hardware API.
//!
//! # Thread-safety design
//!
//! [`crate::backend::MonitoringBackend`] cannot be moved across threads: it stores
//! `Vec<Box<dyn DiskDevice>>` and `Vec<Box<dyn MotherboardDevice>>`, trait objects
//! with no `Send` bound. Rather than retrofit `Send` onto those traits, the collector
//! thread **constructs its own sources** and only ever sends plain owned data
//! ([`Snapshot`]) across the boundary. Nothing that touches a driver ever crosses a
//! thread.
//!
//! On Windows this also matters for COM: `wmi` initializes COM per-thread, and
//! `disk::windows` contains a `COMLibrary::assume_initialized()` path that is only
//! sound on a thread where COM was actually initialized. Every thread this module
//! spawns therefore calls [`com_guard`] first and holds the guard for its lifetime.
