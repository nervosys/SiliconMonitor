//! The closed sets of values simon emits, and what each one means.
//!
//! # The gap this fills
//!
//! [`super::Entity`] says what a reading means. [`super::capability`] says
//! whether simon can produce it here. Neither says what `"no_baseline"` is, and
//! an agent that receives
//!
//! ```json
//! {"status":"no_baseline","recorded":12,"reason":"..."}
//! ```
//!
//! has no way to know whether that is one of three possible values or one of
//! thirty, nor which of them mean "act now". It can handle the case in front of
//! it and will be surprised by the next one.
//!
//! Every enum here is one an agent parses. Declaring the value set closes the
//! last place where simon's output required prior knowledge that simon did not
//! supply.
//!
//! # Why this is derived rather than described
//!
//! The obvious implementation is a hand-written list of strings, and it would be
//! wrong within a release — this project has watched a `rust-version`, a README
//! and a metric registry all drift from the code they described.
//!
//! So `tests/vocabulary_conformance.rs` constructs every real variant, serialises
//! it, and asserts the resulting set is exactly what is declared here. Adding a
//! variant without declaring it fails. Declaring one that does not exist fails.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here
//!
//! Open sets. Setting ids, entity ids and detection rules are enumerable but
//! they grow, and they already have their own catalogues that tests keep honest.
//! This module is for the small closed vocabularies where an agent's handling
//! must be exhaustive.
