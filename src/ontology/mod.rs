//! Machine-readable ontology over everything simon can report.
//!
//! The three interfaces — CLI, TUI, GUI — all render the same underlying readings,
//! but until now each described them in its own words. `cli board` printed
//! `Kernel:`, the GUI printed `Kernel Version`, and the JSON output used
//! `kernel_version`; an agent reading one could not reliably talk about the others.
//! This module is the single naming authority the three surfaces agree on.
//!
//! ## What an entity is
//!
//! Every value simon can report has a stable dotted id — `gpu.0.thermal.temperature`,
//! `cpu.total.utilization`, `disk.0.capacity` — plus a unit and, most importantly,
//! a [`Provenance`].
//!
//! ## Why provenance is the point
//!
//! An agent reading `gpu.0.thermal.critical_temperature = null` learns nothing about
//! *why* it is null, and an agent reading `= 110` cannot tell whether the hardware
//! said so or whether a table of plausible constants did. That distinction is not
//! cosmetic: this repository has repeatedly shipped invented numbers through the same
//! field as measured ones — a boot time of exactly 45s assigned whenever it could not
//! be read, a GPU power percentage whose denominator came from a core-count lookup,
//! Secure Boot reported from the existence of a registry key rather than its value.
//! Each was indistinguishable from a real reading at the point of consumption.
//!
//! [`Provenance`] makes the distinction explicit and machine-checkable, so an agent
//! can refuse to reason about a specification constant as though it were a sample.
