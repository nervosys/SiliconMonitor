//! Resolving ontology ids to live values.
//!
//! [`super::Ontology`] names what simon *can* report; this module answers what it
//! *does* report, right now, on this machine. Without it the ontology is a glossary:
//! an agent can learn that `gpu.0.thermal.temperature` exists but has no way to read
//! it.
//!
//! ## Declared vs. observed provenance
//!
//! An [`super::Entity`] declares the provenance a value is *supposed* to have. A
//! [`Reading`] carries the provenance it *actually* had when taken. These differ
//! routinely and the difference is the useful part: `gpu.0.thermal.temperature` is
//! declared `measured`, but on a machine whose driver exposes no sensor the reading
//! comes back `unavailable` with a note saying so.
//!
//! The rule this module exists to enforce is that a failed read is never dressed as
//! a successful one. There is no path here that substitutes zero, a previous sample,
//! or a plausible constant for a value that could not be obtained — every such
//! substitution this repository has shipped was indistinguishable from a real
//! reading at the point of consumption, which is precisely what a consuming agent
//! cannot afford.
