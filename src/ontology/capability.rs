//! What simon can and cannot do, as data an agent can read.
//!
//! # Why this is not the README
//!
//! The README has a "What simon cannot do" section, and prose is the wrong
//! medium for an agent. An agent deciding whether to trust a reading needs to
//! know *before asking* that macOS has no GPU reader and that the Windows CPU
//! frequency is a rated figure rather than a measured one. Parsing that out of
//! English is exactly the guessing this crate's ontology exists to remove.
//!
//! So the same facts live here as [`Capability`] rows: per surface, per
//! platform, with the evidence that establishes each claim.
//!
//! # The distinction this adds to the reading ontology
//!
//! [`super::Entity`] describes *what a reading means*. This describes *whether
//! simon can produce it at all, and how much that is worth*. They answer
//! different questions and both are needed: an agent that knows
//! `gpu.0.temperature` is degrees Celsius still cannot tell whether asking is
//! futile on this host.
//!
//! [`Support::Unverified`] is the variant that makes this honest rather than
//! promotional. Code that compiles and has never run on real hardware is not
//! "implemented", and this project has shipped several such paths — the Linux
//! profile writers among them. Calling that `Implemented` would be the same
//! class of error as reporting a nominal clock as a measured one.
//!
//! # Automated testing derives from this
//!
//! `tests/capability_conformance.rs` walks this catalogue and cross-checks it
//! against the code: every registered apply handler must be declared here and
//! every declaration must correspond to a handler; every detection rule the IDS
//! can emit must be declared; every ontology domain must be covered. Adding a
//! capability without declaring it fails the build, and declaring one that does
//! not exist fails too.
//!
//! That is the point of putting it in the ontology rather than in a document:
//! a claim that cannot drift is worth more than a claim that is merely true
//! today.
