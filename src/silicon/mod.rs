//! Unified silicon monitoring module
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive monitoring for all types of silicon:
//! - CPUs (including hybrid architectures like P/E cores)
//! - NPUs/ASICs (Neural engines, AI accelerators)
//! - I/O controllers (PCIe, NVMe, USB, Thunderbolt)
//! - Network silicon (WiFi, Ethernet, offload engines)
