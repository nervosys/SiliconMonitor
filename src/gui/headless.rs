//! Headless rendering harness for the GUI.
//!
//! egui draws into a `Context` that needs no window, so a test can run real widget
//! code and read back the text that was actually painted. That matters here because
//! the alternative — screenshotting a live window — proved unusable: on a
//! multi-monitor setup the window handle resolves to transient popups and the
//! captured rect is whatever happened to be on top.
//!
//! More importantly, a screenshot cannot answer the question that actually matters.
//! The Profiles tab rendered all 19 of its groups perfectly while every heading was
//! drawn in the panel colour; a human looking at the window and a naive capture both
//! reported an empty tab. Reading the painted galleys distinguishes "this text was
//! never emitted" from "this text was emitted and could not be seen", which are
//! different bugs with different fixes.
