//! macOS CPU and memory readers.
//!
//! # Why this shells out
//!
//! The precise way to read these is `sysctlbyname`, `host_statistics64` and
//! `host_processor_info` through `libc`. This module instead parses the output of
//! `sysctl`, `vm_stat` and `top`, which the rest of the crate's macOS code already
//! does (see `cpu_cache`), for one reason that outweighs elegance here: **this code
//! has never run on a Mac.** It was written and compile-checked by
//! cross-compilation from Windows.
//!
//! Mach FFI that has never executed is a poor bet — a wrong structure offset or a
//! misread unit produces numbers that look plausible and are wrong, which is the
//! exact failure this project has spent two releases removing. Parsing documented
//! textual output can at least be tested: every parser below is a pure function
//! over a byte string, and the tests feed them real captured output. Those tests
//! run on Linux, Windows and macOS alike.
//!
//! # The one exception
//!
//! [`per_core_ticks`] does call Mach, through `libc::host_processor_info`. It is
//! the only source of per-core figures and of nice time, both of which `top`
//! cannot give at all — so unlike the rest, there is no textual alternative to
//! weigh it against. The two objections above are also answered for it
//! specifically: it is a `libc` call whose signature the compiler checks rather
//! than a structure whose offsets are hand-written, and `tests/macos_readers.rs`
//! executes it on `macos-latest` on every push, asserting that each core's split
//! accounts for that core and that cores differ from one another.
//!
//! `top` parsing remains as the fallback if that call fails, which is the only
//! path on which nice time is still reported as 0.0.
