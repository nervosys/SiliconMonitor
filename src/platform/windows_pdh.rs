//! Per-core delivered performance, from the PDH performance counters.
//!
//! `CallNtPowerInformation`'s `CurrentMhz` is the nominal clock on Windows 10
//! and later — it reads the same value for every core, idle and under load, so
//! `platform::windows::get_cpu_frequency` reports no current clock rather than
//! publishing a specification behind a measurement's provenance. That left
//! `cpu.core.{n}.frequency` absent on every Windows machine.
//!
//! `\Processor Information(*)\% Processor Performance` is what Task Manager
//! reads. It is derived by the kernel from the APERF and MPERF counters, so it
//! reflects clock actually delivered, it differs per core, and it exceeds 100%
//! when a core boosts — on the development machine it ranges from 60% to 124%
//! of a 4400 MHz nominal, which is a real 2.6–5.4 GHz spread.
//!
//! **It is a rate, so it needs two collections separated in time.** The query is
//! therefore opened once and kept, and each call differences against the
//! previous collection — no sleeping in a monitor's refresh path.
//!
//! The interval is primed when the query opens: one collection, a 120 ms sleep,
//! and every call from the first onward has something to difference against.
//!
//! That cost is deliberate. The first shape returned `None` from the first call
//! so the *second* would work, which is right for a monitoring loop and wrong
//! for everything else — **a one-shot process only ever makes a first call**.
//! `simon cli cpu` printed "Clock: not read" on a machine whose cores were at
//! 5 GHz, and would have done so forever; so would one ontology snapshot or one
//! agent tool call. 120 ms once per process, on the first read of a CPU
//! frequency and never again, buys a correct answer for every caller.
