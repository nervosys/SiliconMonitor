//! Read what models an [IronVault] vault holds, and report them beside the
//! hardware that would run them.
//!
//! [IronVault]: https://crates.io/crates/ironvault
//!
//! # Read-only, and that is a design constraint rather than a phase
//!
//! simon reports; it does not manage models. Nothing here unlocks a vault, asks
//! for a passphrase, or writes to one. Three consequences follow from reading
//! IronVault's source rather than assuming:
//!
//! 1. **`Vault::new` creates the vault directory if it is missing** and writes a
//!    `VaultOpened` audit entry. A monitor that brings a vault into existence by
//!    looking for one has changed the thing it was asked to observe, so
//!    [`read_vault`] checks the path first and reports [`VaultStatus::Absent`]
//!    without constructing a `Vault` at all.
//! 2. **`VaultConfig::new` also has side effects**, which the first version of
//!    this module missed and a real run caught: it creates IronVault's config,
//!    data and cache directories and writes a default `config.yaml` when none
//!    exists. On a machine that has never run IronVault, asking simon what
//!    models it has would therefore install IronVault's furniture. So
//!    [`installed`] probes for an existing installation *before* any IronVault
//!    constructor runs, and [`read_vault`] returns [`VaultStatus::Absent`] on a
//!    machine without one having touched nothing.
//!
//!    That probe mirrors IronVault's documented layout rather than asking it,
//!    which is duplication and is the kind that rots. It is here because the
//!    crate offers no way to resolve its paths without creating them; the honest
//!    fix is upstream, and this guard should be deleted the moment
//!    `VaultConfig` gains a read-only path resolver.
//! 3. **Opening writes to the vault's own audit log** unless
//!    `security.audit_log` is off. simon turns it off: it never mutates a vault,
//!    so an entry claiming otherwise on every `simon vault` would be noise in
//!    someone else's compliance record.
//!
//! # Metadata is readable while the vault is locked
//!
//! `list_models` and `list_versions` go through the version backend and take
//! `&self` with no unlock check, so names, formats, sizes and checksums are
//! available without a key. The model *bytes* are not, and simon never asks for
//! them. A locked vault is therefore fully reportable, which is the property
//! that makes this integration honest: no credential ever reaches simon.
//!
//! # What is reported is what IronVault records
//!
//! [`ModelVersion`](ironvault::ModelVersion) carries a version number, format,
//! original and compressed sizes, a timestamp, a SHA-256 checksum and a
//! user-supplied metadata map. It does not carry a quantisation field or a
//! signature status, so neither is reported as though it did. Anything a user
//! put in the metadata map is passed through verbatim, labelled as theirs.
