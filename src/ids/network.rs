//! Network intrusion detection: what is listening, and what changed.
//!
//! # Why this watches listeners rather than traffic
//!
//! simon can enumerate sockets ([`crate::connections`]); it cannot see packet
//! contents, and a detector built on what it cannot see would be a stub with a
//! confident name. What a socket table does answer well is the question that
//! matters most after a compromise: **what is accepting connections on this
//! machine that was not accepting them before, and what owns it?**
//!
//! A new listener is the durable footprint of most remote-access tooling. It is
//! also completely normal — a development server binds a port every day — which
//! is exactly why it is reported as a low-severity certainty rather than a
//! high-severity guess, and why the baseline exists.
//!
//! # Heuristics are labelled as heuristics
//!
//! The port-reputation check ([`Confidence::Possible`]) matches a small table of
//! ports conventionally used by remote-access tools. It will match a developer
//! who chose 4444 for a test server, and it says so: `Possible`, never
//! `Certain`. Nothing in this module may claim `Certain` unless it observed the
//! difference directly, which for network state means "compared against a
//! recorded baseline".
//!
//! # Unattributed is not unowned
//!
//! A socket whose process simon cannot read — commonly one owned by another user
//! without elevation — carries `process: None`, not `"unknown"`. On Windows the
//! owning PID is usually available and the *name* often is not; both are
//! reported independently for that reason.
