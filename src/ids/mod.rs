//! Intrusion detection over the network and the filesystem.
//!
//! # What this is, and what it refuses to be
//!
//! It observes and reports. It does not block a connection, kill a process, or
//! quarantine a file. Every other write path in this crate requires explicit
//! confirmation and an audit record ([`crate::profile::apply`]), and a detector
//! that could sever a network connection on a heuristic would be the largest
//! unconfirmed write simon has ever made.
//!
//! # A detector that cannot say "I do not know" is a liar
//!
//! This is the same rule the ontology is built on — absent, unavailable and zero
//! are three different facts — applied to security, where getting it wrong is
//! more expensive.
//!
//! [`ScanStatus`] therefore distinguishes:
//!
//! - [`ScanStatus::NoBaseline`] — nothing has been recorded to compare against.
//!   **Not "clean".** A first run cannot report that a machine is uncompromised;
//!   it can only report that it now knows what the machine looks like. Reporting
//!   "0 findings" here would be the single most dangerous sentence this module
//!   could emit, because it is what a user most wants to read.
//! - [`ScanStatus::Clean`] — a baseline existed, N things were checked, and
//!   nothing differed. Carries N, because "clean" over three files and "clean"
//!   over three thousand are different claims.
//! - [`ScanStatus::Findings`] — differences, each with evidence.
//! - [`ScanStatus::Failed`] — the scan could not run, with the reason. Distinct
//!   from clean for the obvious reason.
//!
//! # Evidence is not optional
//!
//! [`Finding::new`] is the only constructor and it rejects an empty evidence
//! list. A finding without evidence is an accusation, and this crate's whole
//! position is that a reading without provenance is worse than no reading.
//! An analyst who cannot see what was observed cannot disagree with the verdict.
//!
//! # Confidence is separate from severity
//!
//! They are routinely conflated and they are orthogonal: a *possible* sign of a
//! rootkit is high severity and low confidence, while a *certain* new listening
//! port on 3000 is low severity and high confidence. Collapsing them into one
//! number is how alert fatigue starts.
//!
//! [`Confidence::Certain`] is reserved for facts that were observed directly —
//! this file's hash differs from the recorded one. No heuristic may claim it.
//!
//! # The agentic part, and its limit
//!
//! A model may triage: rank findings, group them, explain what they might mean
//! together. **It may not create a finding, alter its evidence, or raise its
//! confidence.** That is the same rule `tuning` applies to settings — a model
//! may classify the workload, it may not choose the power limit — and it exists
//! for the same reason: a fabricated security finding is indistinguishable from
//! a real one to everyone downstream. See [`triage`].
