//! Size and mtime are metadata, and anything able to rewrite a file is able to

//! that is actually a check.
//!
//! # Unreadable is not unchanged
//!
//! A file the scanner could not open — permissions, a lock, a deleted inode —
//! produces [`FileState::Unreadable`], never a silent skip and never a "matches".
//! On a compromised machine the file an attacker touched is exactly the one most
//! likely to be unreadable, so treating that as "fine" inverts the tool.
//!
//! # The first scan proves nothing
//!
//! Recording a baseline tells you what the machine looks like now, including if
//! it was already compromised when you looked. [`scan`] returns
//! [`ScanStatus::NoBaseline`] on a first run and never [`ScanStatus::Clean`],
//! because a baseline taken after an intrusion is a record of the intrusion, not
