## Features

### ✅ Implemented (Linux)

1. **Device Enumeration**
   - Automatic detection via `/sys/block`
   - Filtering of virtual devices (loop, ram, dm-*)
   - Device type classification (NVMe, SATA SSD, SATA HDD)

2. **Device Information**
   - Model, vendor, firmware version
   - Capacity (total size)
   - Block sizes (logical, physical)
   - Rotation rate detection (HDD vs SSD)
   - Device path

3. **I/O Statistics**
   - Read/write bytes (lifetime counters)
   - Read/write operations count
   - Read/write time (milliseconds)
   - Current queue depth
   - Data from `/sys/block/*/stat`

4. **Temperature Monitoring**
   - NVMe temperature via hwmon (`/sys/block/*/device/hwmon/hwmon*/temp1_input`)
   - Returns temperature in Celsius

5. **Filesystem Information**
   - Mount point detection from `/proc/mounts`
   - Filesystem type (ext4, xfs, btrfs, etc.)
   - Space usage (total, used, available)
   - Inode statistics
   - Read-only flag

6. **Per-Process I/O**
   - Read/write bytes per process
   - Syscall counts
   - Cancelled write bytes
   - Data from `/proc/[pid]/io`

### 🚧 Partially Implemented

- **SMART Attributes** (`DiskDevice::smart_info`): implemented on Linux and
  Windows. The drive's own health verdict and any attributes the platform exposes
  are returned; every counter is `Option`. On Windows, NVMe drives are read from
  the controller's SMART/Health log page and ATA drives from the device SMART data
  structure, both unelevated. `Get-StorageReliabilityCounter` remains as the
  fallback for devices that answer neither — chiefly USB bridges — and it does
  require elevation, failing with `PermissionDenied` otherwise. Verified against
  four physical drives.
- **NVMe Specific Info** (`DiskDevice::nvme_info`): implemented on Linux and
  Windows. On Windows this issues `DeviceIoControl` with
  `StorageDeviceProtocolSpecificProperty` for Identify Controller and the
  SMART/Health log page, supplying NVMe version, controller id, namespace count,
  capacities, power state table, wear, data units, host commands and critical
  warnings — unelevated. Linux reads the controller id and namespace count from
  `/sys/class/nvme`. Returns `NotSupported` for non-NVMe devices, decided by the
  controller rejecting the NVMe protocol rather than by a media-type string.
- **Health Status**: derived from SMART rather than from whether the device file
  exists. The Linux implementation previously returned `Healthy` whenever the path
  was present, which reported the kernel having enumerated a drive as a clean bill
  of health. On Windows NVMe, health now comes from the controller's own critical
  warning bits, wear and remaining spare.

> **Elevation.** The NVMe passthrough needs none, which is worth stating because
> the obvious way to write it does. `\\.\PhysicalDriveN` must be opened with a
> desired access of *zero*: requesting `GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE` is what
> requires Administrator and fails with `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` for a normal user. A
> query-only handle needs no access rights at all.
>
> The same is true of the ATA path, but for a different control code, and the
> difference is the whole reason that path is written the way it is:
>
> | Control code | Access in its `CTL_CODE` | On a zero-access handle |
> |---|---|---|
> | `IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY` | `FILE_ANY_ACCESS` | reaches the driver |
> | `IOCTL_STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE` | `FILE_ANY_ACCESS` | reaches the driver |
> | `IOCTL_ATA_PASS_THROUGH` | `FILE_READ_ACCESS \| FILE_WRITE_ACCESS` | `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` |
>
> `IOCTL_ATA_PASS_THROUGH` is the obvious way to read SATA SMART and it cannot be
> done unelevated: the I/O manager checks the handle's access mask before the
> driver is reached, and a read/write handle on `\\.\PhysicalDriveN` requires
> Administrator. Measured on all four drives of the development machine. simon
> therefore asks `IOCTL_STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE` instead, whose 512
> vendor-specific bytes are the SMART READ DATA structure for an ATA device.
>
> Devices that answer neither — USB bridges that do not tunnel SMART — still
> depend on `Get-StorageReliabilityCounter` and so on elevation. simon reports
> their counters as unavailable rather than as zero — the pre-3.0.0 behaviour
> turned an access-denied error into "0 °C, 0 power-on hours, healthy" for every
> drive on the system.
>
> **The ATA path has not been run against a SATA drive.** The development machine
> has three NVMe drives and a USB gadget; on all of them it returns
> `NotSupported`, which exercises the decline but not the parse. The 512-byte
> structure is covered by `src/disk/ata_smart.rs`'s tests over synthetic buffers,
> which run on all three CI platforms. Anyone with a SATA SSD or HDD should
> compare against `smartctl -A` once — that is the check this has not had.

### ❌ Not Yet Implemented

1. **SMART failure thresholds on Windows**
   - Attribute thresholds come from SMART READ THRESHOLDS, an ATA command with no
     `IOCTL_STORAGE_*` equivalent. Attributes read through
     `IOCTL_STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE` therefore carry a threshold of 0, which is
     also ATA's own encoding for a threshold that never trips. The drive's own
     `PredictFailure` verdict is reported instead, and it is the same judgement the
     thresholds would have produced

2. **macOS Support**
   - IOKit `IOBlockStorageDevice` enumeration
   - IOKit statistics gathering
   - diskutil integration for SMART
   - NVMe temperature from IOKit

3. **SMART Integration**
   - SMART attribute parsing
   - Health prediction
   - Temperature from SMART
   - Wear indicators
   - Error counters

4. **NVMe Advanced Features**
   - NVMe SMART log parsing
   - Power state management
   - Namespace enumeration
   - Controller information
   - Endurance metrics

## Usage Examples

### Basic Disk Enumeration

```rust
use simon::disk;

// Enumerate all disks
let disks = disk::enumerate_disks()?;

for disk in disks {
    println!("{}: {} ({:?})", 
        disk.name(), 
        disk.info()?.model,
        disk.disk_type()
    );
}
```

### I/O Statistics Monitoring

```rust
use simon::disk;
use std::time::Duration;

let disks = disk::enumerate_disks()?;
let disk = &disks[0];

// Get baseline stats
let stats1 = disk.io_stats()?;
std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
let stats2 = disk.io_stats()?;

// Calculate throughput
let read_bytes_per_sec = stats2.read_bytes - stats1.read_bytes;
let write_bytes_per_sec = stats2.write_bytes - stats1.write_bytes;

println!("Read: {} MB/s", read_bytes_per_sec / 1_000_000);
println!("Write: {} MB/s", write_bytes_per_sec / 1_000_000);
```

### Temperature Monitoring

```rust
use simon::disk;

let disks = disk::enumerate_disks()?;

for disk in disks {
    if let Ok(Some(temp)) = disk.temperature() {
        println!("{}: {:.1}°C", disk.name(), temp);
    }
}
```

### Filesystem Information

```rust
use simon::disk;

let disks = disk::enumerate_disks()?;

for disk in disks {
    if let Ok(filesystems) = disk.filesystem_info() {
        for fs in filesystems {
            println!("{}: {} - {:.1}% used",
                fs.mount_point.display(),
                fs.fs_type,
                fs.usage_percent()
            );
        }
    }
}
```

### Per-Process I/O (Linux)

```rust
use simon::disk::linux;

// Get I/O stats for a specific process
let io = linux::get_process_io(1234)?;

println!("Process 1234:");
println!("  Read: {} MB", io.read_bytes / 1_000_000);
println!("  Write: {} MB", io.write_bytes / 1_000_000);
println!("  Syscalls: {} read, {} write", 
    io.read_syscalls, 
    io.write_syscalls
);
```

## Platform-Specific Implementation Details

### Linux

**Data Sources:**
- `/sys/block/*` - Block device information and statistics
- `/sys/block/*/device/model` - Device model
- `/sys/block/*/device/vendor` - Device vendor
- `/sys/block/*/size` - Capacity in 512-byte sectors
- `/sys/block/*/queue/*` - Queue and block size information
- `/sys/block/*/stat` - I/O statistics
- `/sys/block/*/device/hwmon/hwmon*/temp1_input` - NVMe temperature
- `/proc/mounts` - Mounted filesystems
- `/proc/[pid]/io` - Per-process I/O statistics

**Device Types:**
- NVMe: Devices matching `nvme*` pattern
- SATA SSD: `/sys/block/*/queue/rotational` = 0
- SATA HDD: `/sys/block/*/queue/rotational` = 1

**Filtering:**
- Excludes: `loop*`, `ram*`, `dm-*` (virtual devices)

**Future Enhancements:**
- `smartctl` integration for SMART data
- `nvme-cli` integration for NVMe-specific info
- ioctl calls for direct device queries
- udev integration for hotplug support

### Windows

**Data Sources:**
- WMI `Win32_DiskDrive` - Device enumeration and info
- WMI `Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfDisk_PhysicalDisk` - I/O statistics
- `Get-PhysicalDisk` / `Get-StorageReliabilityCounter` - health verdict, and the
  elevated fallback for counters
- `DeviceIoControl` with `IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY` and
  `StorageDeviceProtocolSpecificProperty` - NVMe Identify, health log, Get Features
- `DeviceIoControl` with `IOCTL_STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE` - ATA SMART attributes and
  the drive's failure prediction

**Challenges:**
- Different APIs for SATA vs NVMe devices
- Whether an operation needs Administrator is decided by the `CTL_CODE`'s access
  bits and by the access mask the handle was opened with, not by the operation's
  apparent privilege — see the table above. Both passthrough paths here are
  unelevated because of that, and both would require Administrator if written the
  obvious way

### macOS (Planned)

**Data Sources:**
- IOKit `IOBlockStorageDevice` - Device enumeration
- IOKit statistics dictionary - I/O statistics
- `diskutil info` - Device information and SMART
- `smartctl` - SMART attributes
- IOKit `AppleNVMeController` - NVMe temperature

**Challenges:**
- Requires entitlements for some IOKit operations
- SMART data parsing from diskutil output
- Different APIs for different macOS versions

## SMART Attribute Reference

Common SMART attributes (standardized IDs):

| ID   | Name                      | Description                       |
| ---- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 0x01 | Read Error Rate           | Frequency of read errors          |
| 0x05 | Reallocated Sectors Count | Count of bad sectors remapped     |
| 0x09 | Power-On Hours            | Total hours powered on            |
| 0x0C | Power Cycle Count         | Number of power cycles            |
| 0xC2 | Temperature               | Current temperature (Celsius)     |
| 0xC3 | Hardware ECC Recovered    | Errors corrected by ECC           |
| 0xC4 | Reallocation Events       | Count of reallocation attempts    |
| 0xC5 | Current Pending Sectors   | Sectors waiting to be remapped    |
| 0xC6 | Uncorrectable Sectors     | Sectors that couldn't be remapped |
| 0xC7 | UltraDMA CRC Errors       | Interface errors during transfers |

**Critical Attributes** (often indicate impending failure):
- Reallocated Sectors (0x05)
- Current Pending Sectors (0xC5)
- Uncorrectable Sectors (0xC6)

## NVMe Log Pages

NVMe SMART / Health Information (Log Page 0x02):
- Critical warnings
- Composite temperature
- Available spare
- Available spare threshold
- Percentage used
- Data units read/written
- Host read/write commands
- Controller busy time
- Power cycles
- Power on hours
- Unsafe shutdowns
- Media errors
- Error log entries

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: Device info rarely changes, should be cached. The SMART collector
  is shared process-wide for `smart::CACHE_MAX_AGE` (2 s), because a sweep
  enumerates every drive and the per-device trait would otherwise pay for a whole
  sweep to read one entry — measured at 1.23 s per sweep on Windows, and one
  `smartctl` spawn per drive on Linux
- **I/O Stats**: Updated frequently (every few seconds acceptable)
- **Temperature**: Poll every 5-30 seconds
- **SMART**: Query every minute or on-demand
- **Filesystem**: Update every 10-30 seconds

## Security Considerations

- **Permissions**: Some operations require root/admin
  - SMART data (Linux: CAP_SYS_ADMIN or disk group)
  - NVMe admin commands (root/admin only)
  - Per-process I/O (read own process or CAP_SYS_PTRACE)

- **Safety**: All operations are read-only
  - No write commands implemented
  - No firmware updates
  - No secure erase

## Testing

Run the example:
```bash
# Linux (may need sudo for full functionality)
cargo run --example disk_monitor

# With elevated privileges
sudo cargo run --example disk_monitor
```

Expected output shows:
- Device name and type
- Model, vendor, capacity
- I/O statistics (read/write bytes and operations)
- Temperature (for NVMe devices)
- Mounted filesystems with usage

## Future Enhancements

   - Parse smartctl output or use direct ioctl
   - Health prediction algorithms
   - Attribute change tracking

2. **NVMe Advanced Features**
   - Full NVMe admin command support

   - Telemetry log parsing
   - Firmware slot information

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - IOPS calculation (requires historical data)
   - Latency histograms
   - Queue depth tracking
   - Throughput averaging

4. **Alert System**
   - Temperature thresholds
   - SMART attribute warnings
   - Capacity warnings
   - Health degradation alerts

5. **Historical Data**
   - Time-series storage
   - Wear leveling tracking
