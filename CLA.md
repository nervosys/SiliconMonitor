# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

## Silicon Monitor — Individual Contributor License Agreement v1.0

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Silicon Monitor** (the "Project"),
owned and maintained by **NERVOSYS** (the "Organization").

By submitting a contribution (including but not limited to code, documentation,
artwork, or other materials) to this Project, you agree to the following terms:

## 1. Definitions

- **"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including modifications
  or additions to an existing work, that you intentionally submit to the Project.
- **"Submit"** means any form of communication sent to the Project (e.g., pull request,
  patch, issue comment, mailing list message), excluding communications clearly
  marked "Not a Contribution."

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

You hereby grant to the Organization and recipients of software distributed by
the Organization a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions and such
derivative works.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

You hereby grant to the Organization and recipients of software distributed by
the Organization a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
and otherwise transfer your Contributions, where such license applies only to
patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your
Contribution(s) alone or by combination with the Project.

## 4. Dual-Licensing Authorization

You acknowledge and agree that your Contributions may be distributed under both:

1. The **GNU Affero General Public License v3** (AGPL-3.0-or-later), and
2. A **commercial license** offered by the Organization.

This dual-licensing model enables the Project to remain open source while also
being available under commercial terms for organizations whose use cases are
incompatible with the AGPL.

## 5. Representations

You represent that:

- Each Contribution is your original creation, or you have sufficient rights to
  submit it under these terms.
- Your Contribution does not violate any third party's intellectual property or
  other rights.
- If your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have
  received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or your
  employer has waived such rights for your Contributions.

## 6. Support

You are not expected to provide support for your Contributions, except to the
extent you desire to do so. Support may be provided for free, for a fee, or
not at all.

## 7. No Obligation

The Organization is under no obligation to accept or include any Contribution.
