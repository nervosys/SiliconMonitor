//! Physical plausibility of reported hardware readings.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The unit tests assert that collectors do not panic and that types round-trip.
//! Almost none assert that the *numbers* make physical sense, and that is precisely
//! where this codebase's defects have clustered. Every one of the following shipped
//! and passed a green suite:
//!
//! - A GPU at 80 °C rendered as `0.1 °C`, with warning thresholds that could never
//!   fire, because a degrees value was divided by 1000.
//! - `cli cpu` reported 0% usage / 100% idle on every one-shot invocation, printed
//!   directly above per-core rows showing 23–53%.
//! - Per-core CPU was the system-wide average replicated across all 24 cores.
//! - Memory readings of "32 GB total, 16 GB used" were invented as a fallback.
//! - A display named "Primary Display" was fabricated whenever detection failed.
//! - Windows fan RPM was hardcoded to 1000.
//!
//! Each is invisible to a type checker and to a test that only asks "did it return
//! Ok?". They are visible the moment you ask whether the value could be true of real
//! hardware.
//!
//! # Design rule: conditional strictness
//!
//! These run on developer machines with real hardware and on CI containers with
//! almost none. So the rule throughout is **"if a subsystem reports something, that
//! something must be physically possible"** — never "the subsystem must report
//! something". Absent hardware is not a failure; impossible readings are.
//!
//! A consequence worth stating: these tests cannot prove a reading is *correct*, only
//! that it is not absurd. They are a floor, not a guarantee.
