//! Tests derived from the capability ontology rather than written beside it.
//!
//! # Why derive instead of list
//!
//! A hand-written list of "things that should be declared" is a second copy of
//! the thing it checks, and the two drift. This project has watched that happen
//! more than once: a `rust-version` nothing built against, a README claiming
//! platforms it had never run on, a metric registry described as populated when
//! it was empty.
//!
//! So these tests iterate [`capability::catalogue`] and the code it describes,
//! and assert the two agree in **both** directions. Adding an apply handler
//! without declaring it fails. Declaring a capability for a handler that does
//! not exist fails. Emitting a detection rule that no schema names fails.
//!
//! That is what makes the ontology agentic-first rather than decorative: an
//! agent can read the catalogue and rely on it, because nothing can quietly
//! stop being true.
