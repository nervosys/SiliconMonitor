//! The contract an AI agent relies on when driving simon.
//!
//! `simon describe` hands an agent a schema; `simon get` and `simon snapshot` hand
//! it values. Those are only useful together if they agree — a schema naming ids
//! the resolver never produces, or a resolver emitting ids the schema never
//! declared, sends an agent looking for things that do not exist.
//!
//! These tests drive the built binary rather than the library, because the argv
//! surface is the part an agent actually touches. A library-level test would pass
//! while `simon get` was broken.
