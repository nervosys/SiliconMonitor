//! The macOS CPU and memory readers, exercised on macOS.
//!
//! These were written by cross-compilation from a Windows machine and had never
//! executed anywhere when they were committed. That is the same position the Linux
//! SMART paths were in for 3.0.0, and the answer there turned out to be that CI
//! *is* the missing hardware: the test matrix runs on `macos-latest`, so a test
//! gated to macOS runs the code on a real Mac on every push.
//!
//! So these assert what a reading must satisfy to be a reading — a CPU split that
//! accounts for the whole processor, a memory total that matches installed RAM,
//! used memory that fits inside it. A parser that silently misreads `vm_stat` or
//! `top` fails here rather than shipping numbers nobody checked.
//!
