// exemption every time a legitimately whole-machine metric appeared:
// `simon_gpu_count`, then `simon_swap_used_bytes`, then
// `simon_uptime_seconds`. Three exemptions in one sitting, none of them a
// defect.
//
// **A test that needs a growing allowlist to stay green has stopped testing an
// invariant and started describing the current output.** The failure it was
// built to catch -- an unlabelled metric emitted once per device -- produces
// duplicate samples, and `no_two_samples_share_a_name_and_labels` above
// catches that exactly, with no heuristic and no exemptions.
