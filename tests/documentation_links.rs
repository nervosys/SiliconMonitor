//! Every relative link and image in the repository's markdown must resolve.
//!
//! The README carried six `docs/images/*.png` references for months. None of the
//! files was ever added, so the two "Screenshots" sections rendered as broken
//! images on GitHub — and, once the crate was published, on its crates.io page
//! too. Nothing caught it because a broken *image* fails silently: the markdown is
//! valid, the build is green, and the damage is only visible to a human looking at
//! the rendered page, which is exactly the thing nobody re-reads.
//!
//! A missing target is checkable, so it should be checked rather than noticed.
