//! The dependencies of a cross-platform feature must exist on every platform.
//!
//! From the initial commit until 2.1.2, the CLI, TUI, GUI, remote-AI-backend, and
//! logging dependencies — along with the unconditional `chrono` and `async-trait` —
//! sat below `[target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies]` with no `[dependencies]` header
//! to close it. TOML therefore read all of them as Windows-only.
//!
//! The consequence was total: on Linux and macOS the `cli`, `gui`, and
//! `remote-backends` features enabled code whose crates were not in the dependency
//! graph, so the build failed outright with "cannot find crate `crossterm`" and a
//! dozen more like it. Every one of the eight versions published to crates.io
//! carried it, while the README advertised a native desktop app for Windows, Linux,
//! and macOS.
//!
//! It survived nine months of green local builds because the author's machine was
//! Windows, where the manifest is correct, and because a section header is
//! invisible when you are reading the dependency underneath it — every individual
//! line was right.
//!
//! `cargo tree --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` would have shown it at any point.
//! So this test asks the manifest the same question directly.

/// Features that must resolve on every platform.

/// This started as just `cli`, `gui`, and `remote-backends` — the obviously
/// cross-platform ones — and that was too narrow. `nvidia` names `nvml-wrapper`,
/// which was declared only in the Linux and Windows target sections, so
/// `--all-features` on macOS failed with `unresolved import 'nvml_wrapper'`. A
/// *feature* is not target-conditional even when the hardware it describes is:
/// enabling it on a platform that lacks the dependency is a build failure, not a
/// graceful absence. So every feature is checked, not a chosen few.
///
/// Crates that are target-gated on purpose, and whose *source* is gated to match.
///
/// Naming a target-gated crate from a feature is only safe when every `use` of it
/// is also behind a `cfg(target_os)`. `drm`/`drm-ffi` are Linux kernel interfaces
/// and `plist` is a macOS format; the code touching each is gated accordingly, so
/// enabling `intel` or `apple` elsewhere compiles to nothing rather than failing.
///
/// `nvml-wrapper` was *not* on this list and was not gated that way: the `nvidia`
/// feature named it, the source guarded only on the feature, and `--all-features`
/// on macOS failed with `unresolved import 'nvml_wrapper'`. It is now declared
/// cross-platform instead, which is why it does not appear here.
///
/// Anything new that reaches this list needs the same discipline, so adding to it
/// should be a conscious act rather than a way to quiet the test.
