//! Pin the set of `new()` constructors that fabricate readings.
//!
//! This crate's central claim is that absent, unavailable and zero are different
//! facts. A `new()` that returns `0` for a measurement quietly converts the first
//! two into the third, and does it behind a name that reads like "construct this
//! properly".
//!
//! It has cost twice. `MemoryStats::new()` returns all zeros and `CpuStats::new()`
//! returns no cores and 100% idle; two GUI call sites shipped those numbers to
//! users as readings, found a day apart. The handoff's response was a note
//! telling the next reader to *assume any other `T::new()` may be one until
//! checked*. Nobody had checked, and a note is not a check — which is how the
//! same shape survived in `PowerStats` and `ProcessStats` without anyone
//! recording it.
//!
//! So this is the check, and it runs. Every argument-free `new()` in the crate is
//! classified, and the ones that fabricate numbers are compared against a known
//! list. Adding another fails here until it is deliberately acknowledged.
//!
//! **This test does not say these four are bugs.** All four are currently used
//! only as builder bases inside platform readers, which fill them immediately —
//! the legitimate use. What it says is that the list is exactly this long, so a
//! fifth arrival is noticed by CI rather than by a user reading 0 W off a
//! dashboard.

    // ProcessStats all returned fabricated numbers from a method called `new()`.
    // They are now `empty()`, which says what they do, and no `new()` in this
    // crate fabricates a reading.
    //
    // The rename was not cosmetic. Going to do it turned up three live defects
    // that the misleading name had been hiding: `SiliconMonitor::snapshot_cpu`
    // and `snapshot_memory` returned zeros from the public API, the health
    // checks computed CPU usage from 100% idle so they could never fire, and the
    // Prometheus exporter published 0% CPU on every scrape.
    //
    // Adding an entry here means a `new()` fabricates again. Do not: rename it.
