//! Every public type this crate declares must be mentioned by code somewhere.
//!
//! A type nobody constructs is a type nobody has audited. That is not a style
//! observation — it is where two of this crate's fabrications were still sitting
//! after the sweeps that removed every other one.
//!
//! `NetworkState` kept the bare `f64` rate fields that `e425908` took off every
//! other network rate in the crate, because the sweep looked for code that runs
//! and nothing constructed a `NetworkState`. When `ed4ec44` finally populated
//! `FullSystemState::network` — a public field, serialised by `simon cli all
//! --format json`, that had come back `[]` on a host with twenty interfaces —
//! the fabrication came with it and had to be fixed on the way through.
//!
//! The same audit found 391 of the 619 lines of `ai_api::types` unreachable: a
//! whole `*Details` family, published through `pub use types::*`, that no
//! function returns and whose shape matches nothing the tools emit. Its fields
//! were flat and non-`Option` — per-core clocks, power draw, temperatures, SMART
//! attributes — declaring as always-present exactly the readings this crate has
//! spent a hundred commits establishing are usually absent. Anyone wiring them
//! up would have imported the fabrication wholesale.
//!
//! So: no allowlist. A public `struct` or `enum` that appears nowhere but its own
//! declaration is either dead and should be deleted, or is a promise the crate
//! has not kept and should be wired up. Both are the author's decision to make
//! deliberately, which is what failing here asks for.
