//! What the `ai_api` tool surface actually returns.
//!
//! `tests/agentic_contract.rs` covers the argv surface — `simon describe`, `get`,
//! `snapshot` — and `tests/ontology_conformance.rs` covers readings. Neither
//! covers `AiDataApi::call_tool`, which is the surface an LLM driving simon
//! through MCP touches, and nothing else did either. Three fabrications lived
//! there undisturbed as a result: `uptime_seconds: 0` marked "would need
//! platform-specific impl" next to a reader that had one, a macOS CPU arm
//! publishing load average as `usage_percent`, and `unwrap_or_default()` turning
//! unread strings into `""`.
//!
//! These tests assert about *shape*, not about particular hardware, so they say
//! the same thing on a developer's desktop and on a CI runner with no GPU.
