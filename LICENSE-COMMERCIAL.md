# Commercial License for Silicon Monitor

Copyright (C) 2024-2026 NERVOSYS. All rights reserved.

## Dual Licensing

Silicon Monitor is available under two licensing options:

### 1. Open Source — GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)

The default license for Silicon Monitor is the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0** (AGPL-3.0). Under this license, you are free to use, modify, and distribute the software, provided that:

- Any modified versions you distribute (including use over a network) must also be released under AGPL-3.0.
- You must make the complete source code available to all users who interact with the software, including users interacting over a network.
- All derivative works must carry the same license terms.

See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the full AGPL-3.0 text.

### 2. Commercial License

If AGPL-3.0 is not suitable for your use case — for example, if you want to:

- Embed Silicon Monitor in proprietary/closed-source software
- Use Silicon Monitor in a SaaS product without open-sourcing your application
- Distribute Silicon Monitor without AGPL-3.0 obligations
- Receive dedicated support, warranty, or indemnification

Then a **commercial license** is available from NERVOSYS.
