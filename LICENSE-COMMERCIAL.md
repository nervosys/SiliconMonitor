# Commercial License for Silicon Monitor

Copyright (C) 2024-2026 NERVOSYS. All rights reserved.

## Dual Licensing

Silicon Monitor is available under two licensing options:

### 1. GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0-or-later)

The default license for Silicon Monitor is the **GNU Affero General Public License v3**. Under this license:

- You may freely use, copy, modify, and distribute the software.
- If you modify the software and make it available over a network (e.g., as a web service), you **must** make the complete source code of your modified version available to users of that service.
- Any derivative works must also be licensed under the AGPL v3.
- Full text: [LICENSE](LICENSE)

### 2. Commercial License

If the AGPL requirements are incompatible with your use case — for example, if you want to:

- Integrate Silicon Monitor into proprietary/closed-source software
- Distribute Silicon Monitor without disclosing your source code
- Offer Silicon Monitor as a hosted/SaaS service without AGPL obligations
- Use the software under terms that do not require network-use disclosure
- Receive dedicated support, warranty, or indemnification

Then a **commercial license** is available from NERVOSYS.
