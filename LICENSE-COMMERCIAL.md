# Commercial License for Silicon Monitor

Copyright (C) 2024-2026 NERVOSYS. All rights reserved.

## Dual Licensing

Silicon Monitor is available under two licensing options:

### 1. Open Community License v1 (OCL)

The default license for Silicon Monitor is the **Open Community License v1** (OCL). Under this license:

**Non-commercial end users** may freely use, copy, modify, and hack the software. If you distribute derivatives, you must do so under the OCL or a compatible non-commercial share-alike license.

**Commercial business users** may use and modify the software solely for internal production use. You must not copy, replicate, or redistribute the software or its components for any commercial purpose beyond internal use without obtaining a separate business license.

**Data mining restriction**: Systematic or automated text/data mining of the software is prohibited without explicit permission.

See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the full OCL v1 text.  
Canonical license: <https://github.com/OpenCommunityLicence/OpenCommunityLicence>

### 2. Commercial Business License

If the OCL terms are not suitable for your use case — for example, if you want to:

- Distribute Silicon Monitor as part of a commercial product
- Resell or white-label Silicon Monitor
- Offer Silicon Monitor as a hosted/SaaS service
- Replicate or embed the software in ways beyond internal production use
- Receive dedicated support, warranty, or indemnification

Then a **commercial business license** is available from NERVOSYS.
